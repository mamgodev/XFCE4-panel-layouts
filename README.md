# XFCE4-panel-layouts
# Updated to 4.16
Layouts configurations for XFCE4 (4.16). 

## Reason 
The reason why I'm creating this is because I want to contribute to xfce but I don't know how to code yet*, so I though this would be a good idea to contribute, also I like to customize and xfce offers this, so why not use it?

# READ
- NEEDS XFCE4 PANEL PROFILES (https://docs.xfce.org/apps/xfce4-panel-profiles/start)
- SOME LAYOUTS NEED TO HAVE SOME XFCE PLUGINS.
- HAVEN'T TEST IT IN ANOTHER COMPUTER SO THEY MIGHT NOT WORK CORRECTLY, IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM CONTACT ME.

Note: This layout is for fun and to try new things. Doubt someone would use it.

## IDEAS

1. Add more layouts.

Not sure
2. GUI to manage layouts, (installs, updates, apply custom icons/GTK themes?)
