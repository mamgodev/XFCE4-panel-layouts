# XFCE4-panel-layouts
Layouts configurations for XFCE4 (4.14). 

## Reason 
The reason why I'm creating this is because I want to contribute to xfce but I don't know how to code yet*, so I though this would be a good idea? to contribute, also I like to customize and xfce offers this so why not use it?

# READ
# NOTE: SOME LAYOUTS MAY NEED TO HAVE SOME XFCE PLUGINS. HAVEN'T TEST IT IN ANOTHER COMPUTER. NEED TO INCLUDE THEM TO KNOW WHICH ONE YOU NEED.

## Layouts

## 1. GNOME2

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shinixxx/XFCE4-panel-layouts/master/GNOME2/GNOME2-1.png?raw=true)

Tries to mimic Gnome2 layout, maybe I'll add some alternatives like the Ubuntu used without the System, not sure.

## 2. Unity

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shinixxx/XFCE4-panel-layouts/master/Unity/Unity.png?raw=true)

Tries to mimic the Unity style, doesn't include a menu like unity did or has global-menu/window buttons on the top panel. Maybe in the future.

## 3. W10

Maybe I should change the name?

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shinixxx/XFCE4-panel-layouts/master/W10/W10-1.png?raw=true)

Tries to mimic a W10 style. Simple.

## 4. WXP

Maybe I should change the name?

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shinixxx/XFCE4-panel-layouts/master/WXP/WXP-1.png?raw=true)

Tries to mimic the good old WXP style.

## [NEW] 5. ElementaryOs style

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shinixxx/XFCE4-panel-layouts/master/elementary/elementary-1.png?raw=true)

Tries to mimic the elementaryOs style.

In order to work you need:
 - Plank for the dock or any other alternative like DockbarX/Docklike Taskbar (you will need to add a new panel at the bottom, if need help ask me).
 

## TODO

1. Need to add the plugins necessary for the layout to work.
2. Add more layouts like:
  - Mac?
  - ~~Elementary?~~
  - Custom?
3. Make some tweaks to the layouts.
4. GUI for layouts, (installs, updates, apply custom icons/GTK themes?)
  - Example: https://github.com/QaldeK/geox-tweak-xfce

# IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTION LIKE NEW LAYOUTS PLEASE TELL ME :)
